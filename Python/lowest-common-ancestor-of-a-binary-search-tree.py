# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
# of two given nodes in the BST.
#
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
# is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
# and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
# Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a
# descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
